Implementation
==============


**Overview**

The Student Recipe App is an application that allows users to search for recipes, save their favorites, plan meals, and generate shopping lists. The app integrates Firebase for backend services, including user authentication, data storage, and retrieval.

**App Architecture**

The app follows a component-based architecture, where each page (e.g., Home Page, Recipe Page, etc.) is built using Flutter widgets. Firebase serves as the backend for managing user data, recipes, and meal plans.

The frontend and backend interact through Firebase Firestore and Firebase Authentication. Firestore stores the recipes, user profiles, and meal plans, while Firebase Authentication handles user login.

**Firebase Integration**

Firebase is used for the following features:
- **Authentication**: Users sign in using Firebase Authentication (Google sign-in).
- **Firestore**: Stores and retrieves recipe data, user preferences, bookmarks, and meal plans.

**UI Implementation**

The user interface was designed with a modern, minimalistic approach, using a navigation bar. Key screens include:
- **Home Page**: Displays a list of suggested recipes.
- **Recipe Page**: Provides details about a selected recipe.
- **Meal Plan Page**: Allows users to select and plan meals for specific days.



**Key Features Implementation**

- **Recipe Search and Filtering**: 
  Users can search for recipes based on multiple filters, such as ingredients, difficulty, and time. This functionality is powered by Firestore queries and Flutter's search bar widget.
  
- **Bookmarking**: 
  Users can bookmark their favorite recipes. Bookmarked recipes are displayed on the Bookmarks page.
  
- **Meal Planning**: 
  The Meal Plan page allows users to select recipes for specific days and store these selections in Firebase. Users can view their meal plan in a calendar format.

- **Shopping List**: 
  The Shopping List page allows users to either create their own or generated a shopping list based on their meal plan.

**Handling User Data**

User data, including authentication information and preferences, is stored securely in Firebase. Firebase Authentication is used for secure login, and Firestore handles user-specific data (e.g., bookmarks, meal plans).
